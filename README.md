# Artemis_Financial_Secure_Software_Artifacts
This repository contains artifacts developed during my CS305 course. These artifacts showcase my skills in secure software development and vulnerability assessment. They demonstrate my ability to identify and mitigate security risks while ensuring the functionality and security of software applications.

Client Overview
Artemis Financial, a financial services company, required a secure software solution to address vulnerabilities in their existing system. The company sought assistance in protecting sensitive client data and ensuring secure communications within their application.

Security Vulnerabilities and Their Importance
I excelled in identifying Artemis Financial's software vulnerabilities by conducting thorough manual reviews and static testing using OWASP Dependency-Check. Secure coding is critical to preventing data breaches, ensuring data integrity, and maintaining client trust. Implementing strong software security enhances a companyâ€™s reputation, minimizes risks, and prevents potential legal and financial liabilities.

Challenges and Insights
The most challenging aspect of the vulnerability assessment was analyzing dependency-check reports and correlating findings with actionable mitigation steps. This process improved my understanding of software dependencies and their associated risks. On the other hand, implementing encryption and HTTPS was a helpful and insightful experience.

Enhancing Security Layers
To increase security layers, I implemented:

AES-256 encryption for data confidentiality.
Checksum functionality using SHA-256 for data integrity.
HTTPS for secure communication via self-signed certificates.
In future projects, I would continue using tools like OWASP ZAP, SAST scanners, and manual reviews to assess vulnerabilities and determine effective mitigation techniques.

Ensuring Functionality and Security
To ensure the functionality and security of the refactored code:

Conducted functional and secondary testing to verify expected outcomes.
Used checksum comparisons to confirm data integrity.
Performed HTTPS validation to ensure secure communication channels.
Re-ran static tests to confirm no new vulnerabilities were introduced.
Tools and Practices Used
Key tools and practices included:

OWASP Dependency-Check: For static analysis.
Java Keytool: To generate self-signed certificates.
AES-256 encryption: For robust data security.
Secure coding standards: To comply with industry best practices.
These resources will be invaluable for future projects, ensuring high-quality, secure software solutions.
