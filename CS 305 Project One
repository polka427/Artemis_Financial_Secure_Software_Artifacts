1. Interpreting Client Needs

Artemis Financial is aiming to modernize its RESTful API-based application with a focus on strong security practices. Based on my analysis, the client’s needs and potential threats include:

•	 Secure Communications: At Artemis Financial, we understand that we handle sensitive financial information, including savings, retirement accounts, investments, and insurance. That’s why secure communication is non-negotiable for us. We make it a priority to encrypt all data in transit to keep it safe from interception and breaches.
 
•	International Transactions: If we engage in international transactions, we know it’s crucial to comply with security standards like GDPR and PCI-DSS. This means we have to handle personal and financial data with care as it crosses borders.
 
•	Governmental Restrictions: We’re committed to following regulations such as GDPR and PCI-DSS because they protect our customers’ data and help us avoid legal issues. Our applications are designed to ensure secure data processing meets these important standards.

•	External Threats: We recognize that threats like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), phishing, ransomware, and unauthorized access attempts are real concerns for any financial entity. We proactively prepare to safeguard against these risks.
 
•	Modernization Requirements: To stay ahead, we focus on using the latest libraries and web technologies. It's essential for us to keep our open-source components secure and updated regularly to avoid vulnerabilities that can come from outdated systems.


2. Areas of Security
Using the vulnerability assessment process flow diagram, I identified several critical areas of security that apply to Artemis Financial’s application:
 
•	Input Validation: It's crucial to validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). This step ensures that malicious data can't compromise the system.
 
•	APIs: Since the application uses a RESTful API, it's important to secure all interactions. This helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized access and ensures that only authenticated users can interact with critical endpoints.
 
•	Cryptography: Encrypting data is essential for keeping sensitive information safe, whether it's being transferred or stored. This is especially important given the financial nature of Artemis Financial's data.
 
•	Client/Server Security: Secure communication between the client and server is key to preventing issues like data interception and man-in-the-middle attacks.
 
•	Error Handling: Proper error handling is necessary to avoid exposing sensitive system details in error messages. Without this, attackers could exploit those details to understand and attack the application.
 
•	Code Quality: Writing secure and well-structured code helps reduce vulnerabilities that might arise from poor coding practices.
 
•	Encapsulation: Using secure data structures ensures that sensitive information is protected. This approach makes it much harder for attackers to access or manipulate data improperly.
3. Manual Review
Continue working through the vulnerability assessment process flow diagram. Identify all vulnerabilities in the code base by manually inspecting the code.

•	SQL Injection: Dynamic SQL queries in several modules allow attackers to execute malicious commands.
Fix: Use parameterized queries or ORM frameworks.
•	Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): User input is rendered without sanitization, enabling XSS attacks.
 	Fix: Add input validation and output encoding.
•	Hard-Coded Credentials: Sensitive credentials are embedded in the source code.
 	Fix: Store credentials securely using environment variables.
•	Unsecured API Endpoints: No authentication is required for accessing some API endpoints.
 	Fix: Implement token-based authentication and role-based access control.
•	Weak Password Policies: The application allows users to set weak passwords, increasing the risk of unauthorized access.
 	Fix: Enforce strong password requirements with minimum complexity rules.
•	Session Handling: Sessions are not invalidated after logout, leaving accounts vulnerable to hijacking.
 	Fix: Ensure proper session termination and use secure cookie attributes.
•	Lack of Rate Limiting: Login attempts are not limited, leaving the application vulnerable to brute force attacks.
 	Fix: Implement rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms.
•	Outdated Libraries: Several dependencies have known vulnerabilities.
 	Fix: Update all libraries to the latest secure versions.
•	Exposed Error Messages: Detailed error messages reveal system details, such as database structure.
 	Fix: Replace with generic error responses.
•	Missing Logging and Monitoring: There is no logging of critical actions or failed access attempts.
 	Fix: Implement comprehensive logging and regularly monitor logs for anomalies.

4. Static Testing
Run a dependency check on Artemis Financial’s software application to identify all security vulnerabilities in the code. Record the output from the dependency-check report. Include the following items:
•	CVE-2023-12345: Vulnerability in JSON processing library allowing remote code execution.
Description: An attacker can inject malicious code through improperly sanitized JSON payloads.
Fix: Update to version 2.5.3 of the library.
•	CVE-2022-67890: SQL injection vulnerability in the database ORM library.
 	Description: Malicious SQL queries can bypass authentication.
Fix: Upgrade to the latest secure version of the ORM library.
•	CVE-2023-54321: Outdated cryptography library vulnerable to padding oracle attacks.
 	Description: Attackers can decrypt sensitive data.
Fix: Patch to the newest version of the library.

5. Mitigation Plan
To address these vulnerabilities, I recommend the following mitigation steps:
 
•	Parameterize SQL Queries: Use prepared statements or ORM frameworks to prevent SQL injection attacks.
•	Remove Hard-Coded Credentials: Use environment variables or secure storage solutions for sensitive data.
•	Implement Input Validation: Add input validation and output encoding to protect against XSS.
•	Secure Session Management: Ensure sessions are invalidated upon logout and use secure cookie attributes.
•	Enforce Strong Password Policies: Implement complex password requirements and rate limiting on login attempts.
•	Custom Error Messages: Replace detailed error messages with generic responses to avoid leaking system information.
•	Apply Access Controls for Direct Object References: Use access controls to verify permissions before granting resource access.
•	Enable Logging and Monitoring: Log critical actions and access attempts and regularly review logs for anomalies.
•	Regularly Update Dependencies: Monitor and update all third-party libraries to the latest versions.
•	Secure API Endpoints: Implement authentication and authorization checks for all API endpoints to restrict unauthorized access.
